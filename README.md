This is the second optional project I'm taking on to help me solidify the concepts learned in Launch School courses RB175 and RB185, in preparation for the RB189 project assessment. It will be the most complicated networked app I've built so far.

Because this project will involve passwords, and because it will be relying on the local file system for data storage, I am following the recommendation from RB175 and not deploying this to heroku. However, it may be downloaded from this Git Repo.

Actually I think I won't build this, it's a big project and although I believe I would be able to do it within a couple weeks, I feel like I might as well sink that time into a very polished assessment project instead (given that I'll have 30 days it should be fine).
